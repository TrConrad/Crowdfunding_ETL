# Crowdfunding_ETL - By Dianna Rivera, Patrick Schulze, and Tiffany Conrad

This Project was an exercise in utilizing ETL’s on multiple data sources. We were challenged to extract crowdfunding data from multiple sources, in this case two excel sheets, then transform it into data tables for easier analysis. Once the data was transformed into data tables, it was split into separate columns, several of which were broken down further, such as how the “category & sub-category” column became the “category” and “subcategory” columns. From there, individual columns were converted to different datatypes, while unnecessary columns were removed entirely. Once the data was transformed and cleaned, it was saved to four separate csv files, which were then used to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), which was created using the QuickDBD website. Once the data types, keys and other constraints were assigned within the ERD, it was saved to a database schema in Postgres file via PgAdmin. A new database schema was then created to create tables, to which the four CSV files we created were then imported.
